    A class that wraps an AudioProcessor as an AudioIODeviceCallback, so its
    output can be streamed directly to/from some audio and midi inputs and outputs.

    To use it, just create an instance of this for your filter, and register it
    as the callback with an AudioIODevice or AudioDeviceManager object.

    To receive midi input in your filter, you should also register it as a
    MidiInputCallback with a suitable MidiInput or an AudioDeviceManager.

    And for an even easier way of doing a standalone plugin, see the
    AudioFilterStreamingDeviceManager class...
