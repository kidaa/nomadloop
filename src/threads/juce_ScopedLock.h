/**
    Automatically unlocks and re-locks a CriticalSection object.

    This is the reverse of a ScopedLock object - instead of locking the critical
    section for the lifetime of this object, it unlocks it.

    Make sure you don't try to unlock critical sections that aren't actually locked!

    e.g. @code

    CriticalSection myCriticalSection;

    for (;;)
    {
        const ScopedLock myScopedLock (myCriticalSection);
        // myCriticalSection is now locked

            ... do some stuff with it locked ..

            // myCriticalSection is now unlocked for the remainder of this block,
            // and re-locked at the end.
