/**
    Receives callbacks about changes to some kind of object.

    Many objects use a ChangeListenerList to keep a set of listeners which they
    will inform when something changes. A subclass of ChangeListener
    is used to receive these callbacks.

    Note that the major difference between an ActionListener and a ChangeListener
    is that for a ChangeListener, multiple changes will be coalesced into fewer
    callbacks, but ActionListeners perform one callback for every event posted.
