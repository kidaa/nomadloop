/**
    Repeatedly calls a user-defined method at a specified time interval.

    A Timer's timerCallback() method will be repeatedly called at a given
    interval. Initially when a Timer object is created, they will do nothing
    until the startTimer() method is called, then the message thread will
    start calling it back until stopTimer() is called.

    The time interval isn't guaranteed to be precise to any more than maybe
    10-20ms, and the intervals may end up being much longer than requested if the
    system is busy. Because it's the message thread that is doing the callbacks,
    any messages that take a significant amount of time to process will block
    all the timers for that period.

    If you need to have a single callback that is shared by multiple timers with
    different frequencies, then the MultiTimer class allows you to do that - its
    structure is very similar to the Timer class, but contains multiple timers
    internally, each one identified by an ID number.
