/**
    This class holds a pointer which is automatically deleted when this object goes
    out of scope.

    Once a pointer has been passed to a ScopedPointer, it will make sure that the pointer
    gets deleted when the ScopedPointer is deleted. Using the ScopedPointer on the stack or
    as member variables is a good way to use RAII to avoid accidentally leaking dynamically
    created objects.

    A ScopedPointer can be used in pretty much the same way that you'd use a normal pointer
    to an object. If you use the assignment operator to assign a different object to a
    ScopedPointer, the old one will be automatically deleted.

    If you need to get a pointer out of a ScopedPointer without it being deleted, you
    can use the release() method.
