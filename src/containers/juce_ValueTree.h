/**
    A powerful tree structure that can be used to hold free-form data, and which can
    handle its own undo and redo behaviour.

    A ValueTree contains a list of named properties as var objects, and also holds
    any number of sub-trees.

    Create ValueTree objects on the stack, and don't be afraid to copy them around, as
    they're simply a lightweight reference to a shared data container. Creating a copy
    of another ValueTree simply creates a new reference to the same underlying object - to
    make a separate, deep copy of a tree you should explicitly call createCopy().

    Each ValueTree has a type name, in much the same way as an XmlElement has a tag name,
    and much of the structure of a ValueTree is similar to an XmlElement tree.
    You can convert a ValueTree to and from an XmlElement, and as long as the XML doesn't
    contain text elements, the conversion works well and makes a good serialisation
    format. They can also be serialised to a binary format, which is very fast and compact.

    All the methods that change data take an optional UndoManager, which will be used
    to track any changes to the object. For this to work, you have to be careful to
    consistently always use the same UndoManager for all operations to any node inside
    the tree.

    A ValueTree can only be a child of one parent at a time, so if you're moving one from
    one tree to another, be careful to always remove it first, before adding it. This
    could also mess up your undo/redo chain, so be wary! In a debug build you should hit
    assertions if you try to do anything dangerous, but there are still plenty of ways it
    could go wrong.

    Listeners can be added to a ValueTree to be told when properies change and when
    nodes are added or removed.
