/**
    An instance of this class is used to specify initialisation and shutdown
    code for the application.

    An application that wants to run in the JUCE framework needs to declare a
    subclass of JUCEApplication and implement its various pure virtual methods.

    It then needs to use the START_JUCE_APPLICATION macro somewhere in a cpp file
    to declare an instance of this class and generate a suitable platform-specific
    main() function.

    e.g. @code
        class MyJUCEApp  : public JUCEApplication
        {
            // NEVER put objects inside a JUCEApplication class - only use pointers to
            // objects, which you must create in the initialise() method.
            MyApplicationWindow* myMainWindow;

        public:
            MyJUCEApp()
                : myMainWindow (0)
            {
                // never create any Juce objects in the constructor - do all your initialisation
                // in the initialise() method.
            }

            ~MyJUCEApp()
            {
                // all your shutdown code must have already been done in the shutdown() method -
                // nothing should happen in this destructor.
            }

            void initialise (const String& commandLine)
            {
                myMainWindow = new MyApplicationWindow();
                myMainWindow->setBounds (100, 100, 400, 500);
                myMainWindow->setVisible (true);
            }

            void shutdown()
            {
                delete myMainWindow;
            }

            const String getApplicationName()
            {
                return T("Super JUCE-o-matic");
            }

            const String getApplicationVersion()
            {
                return T("1.0");
            }
        };

        // this creates wrapper code to actually launch the app properly.
        START_JUCE_APPLICATION (MyJUCEApp)
    @endcode

    Because this object will be created before Juce has properly initialised, you must
    NEVER add any member variable objects that will be automatically constructed. Likewise
    don't put ANY code in the constructor that could call Juce functions. Any objects that
    you want to add to the class must be pointers, which you should instantiate during the
    initialise() method, and delete in the shutdown() method.

        their changes before quitting, and give them the chance to cancel.
