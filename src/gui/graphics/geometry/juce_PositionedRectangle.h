/**
    A rectangle whose co-ordinates can be defined in terms of absolute or
    proportional distances.

    Designed mainly for storing component positions, this gives you a lot of
    control over how each co-ordinate is stored, either as an absolute position,
    or as a proportion of the size of a parent rectangle.

    It also allows you to define the anchor points by which the rectangle is
    positioned, so for example you could specify that the top right of the
    rectangle should be an absolute distance from its parent's bottom-right corner.

    This object can be stored as a string, which takes the form "x y w h", including
    symbols like '%' and letters to indicate the anchor point. See its toString()
    method for more info.

    Example usage:
    @code
    class MyComponent
    {
        void resized()
        {
            // this will set the child component's x to be 20% of our width, its y
            // to be 30, its width to be 150, and its height to be 50% of our
            // height..
            const PositionedRectangle pos1 ("20% 30 150 50%");
            pos1.applyToComponent (*myChildComponent1);

            // this will inset the child component with a gap of 10 pixels
            // around each of its edges..
            const PositionedRectangle pos2 ("10 10 20M 20M");
            pos2.applyToComponent (*myChildComponent2);
        }
    };
    @endcode

        The format is four co-ordinates, "x y w h".

        - If a co-ordinate is absolute, it is stored as an integer, e.g. "100".
        - If a co-ordinate is proportional to its parent's width or height, it is stored
          as a percentage, e.g. "80%".
        - If the X or Y co-ordinate is relative to the parent's right or bottom edge, the
          number has "R" appended to it, e.g. "100R" means a distance of 100 pixels from
          the parent's right-hand edge.
        - If the X or Y co-ordinate is relative to the parent's centre, the number has "C"
          appended to it, e.g. "-50C" would be 50 pixels left of the parent's centre.
        - If the X or Y co-ordinate should be anchored at the component's right or bottom
          edge, then it has "r" appended to it. So "-50Rr" would mean that this component's
          right-hand edge should be 50 pixels left of the parent's right-hand edge.
        - If the X or Y co-ordinate should be anchored at the component's centre, then it
          has "c" appended to it. So "-50Rc" would mean that this component's
          centre should be 50 pixels left of the parent's right-hand edge. "40%c" means that
          this component's centre should be placed 40% across the parent's width.
        - If it's a width or height that should use the parentSizeMinusAbsolute mode, then
          the number has "M" appended to it.

        To reload a stored string, use the constructor that takes a string parameter.
