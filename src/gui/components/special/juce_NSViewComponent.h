    A Mac-specific class that can create and embed an NSView inside itself.

    To use it, create one of these, put it in place and make sure it's visible in a
    window, then use setView() to assign an NSView to it. The view will then be
    moved and resized to follow the movements of this component.

    Of course, since the view is a native object, it'll obliterate any
    juce components that may overlap this component, but that's life.
