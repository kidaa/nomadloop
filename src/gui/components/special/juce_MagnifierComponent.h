/**
    A component that contains another component, and can magnify or shrink it.

    This component will continually update its size so that it fits the zoomed
    version of the content component that you put inside it, so don't try to
    change the size of this component directly - instead change that of the
    content component.

    To make it all work, the magnifier uses extremely cunning ComponentPeer tricks
    to remap mouse events correctly. This means that the content component won't
    appear to be a direct child of this component, and instead will think its
    on the desktop.
