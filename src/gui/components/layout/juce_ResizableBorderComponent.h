/**
    A component that resizes its parent window when dragged.

    This component forms a frame around the edge of a component, allowing it to
    be dragged by the edges or corners to resize it - like the way windows are
    resized in MSWindows or Linux.

    To use it, just add it to your component, making it fill the entire parent component
    (there's a mouse hit-test that only traps mouse-events which land around the
    edge of the component, so it's even ok to put it on top of any other components
    you're using). Make sure you rescale the resizer component to fill the parent
    each time the parent's size changes.

        Pass in the target component which you want to be resized when this one is
        dragged.

        The target component will usually be a parent of the resizer component, but this
        isn't mandatory.

        Remember that when the target component is resized, it'll need to move and
        resize this component to keep it in place, as this won't happen automatically.

        If the constrainer parameter is non-zero, then this object will be used to enforce
        limits on the size and position that the component can be stretched to. Make sure
        that the constrainer isn't deleted while still in use by this object.
