/**
    Animates a set of components, moving it to a new position.

    To use this, create a ComponentAnimator, and use its animateComponent() method
    to tell it to move components to destination positions. Any number of
    components can be animated by one ComponentAnimator object (if you've got a
    lot of components to move, it's much more efficient to share a single animator
    than to have many animators running at once).

    You'll need to make sure the animator object isn't deleted before it finishes
    moving the components.

    The class is a ChangeBroadcaster and sends a notification when any components
    start or finish being animated.

        If the component is already in the middle of an animation, that will be abandoned,

                                    to arrive at its destination
        @param startSpeed           a value to indicate the relative start speed of the
                                    animation. If this is 0, the component will start
                                    by accelerating from rest; higher values mean that it
                                    will have an initial speed greater than zero. If the
                                    value if greater than 1, it will decelerate towards the
                                    middle of its journey. To move the component at a constant
                                    rate for its entire animation, set both the start and
                                    end speeds to 1.0
        @param endSpeed             a relative speed at which the component should be moving
                                    when the animation finishes. If this is 0, the component
                                    will decelerate to a standstill at its final position; higher
                                    values mean the component will still be moving when it stops.
