    Object for monitoring a component, and later testing whether it's still valid.

    Slightly obscure, this one, but it's used internally for making sure that
    after some callbacks, a component hasn't been deleted. It's more reliable than
    just using isValidComponent(), which can provide false-positives if a new
    component is created at the same memory location as an old one.
