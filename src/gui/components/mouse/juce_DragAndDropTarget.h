/**
    Components derived from this class can have things dropped onto them by a DragAndDropContainer.

    To create a component that can receive things drag-and-dropped by a DragAndDropContainer,
    derive your component from this class, and make sure that it is somewhere inside a
    DragAndDropContainer component.

    Note: If all that you need to do is to respond to files being drag-and-dropped from
    the operating system onto your component, you don't need any of these classes: instead
    see the FileDragAndDropTarget class.
